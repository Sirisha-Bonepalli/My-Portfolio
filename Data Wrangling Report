Project Title: Data Wrangling for Property Tax Dataset

Project Description:

The goal of this project is to clean, transform and achieve data consistency, accuracy and usability for further analysis on the property tax dataset.

Objective:

•	Handle missing values effectively.

•	Remove duplicate records.

•	Encode categorical variables for machine learning models.

•	Rename columns for better readability and consistency.

Dataset:

•	Name: Property Tax Dataset

•	Format: CSV

•	Attributes: Contains numerical and categorical variables related to property tax records.

Methodology:

1.	Handling Missing Data

o	Numeric features: Replaced missing values with the median.

o	Categorical features: Filled missing values with the mode.

2.	Removing Duplicates

o	Identified and removed duplicate rows.

3.	Encoding Categorical Variables

o	Used Label Encoding to convert categorical values into numerical format.

4.	Column Name Standardization

o	Removed special characters and converted column names to lowercase.

Tools and Technologies:

•	Python (for scripting)

•	Pandas (data manipulation)

•	NumPy (handling numerical operations)

•	Scikit-learn (Label Encoding)

Deliverables:

•	Cleaned and structured dataset.

•	Python script for data wrangling.

•	Summary of modifications and transformations applied.
